# Ganitansh

Ganitansh was my first 'real' team high school project. We made this for Toycathon 2021. Our aim was to deliver magic of maths to all kinds of people. 

**We believe that no disability can stop someone to explore the magic of maths.**    

In between the code a lot of funtions are commented. We are working on them.
