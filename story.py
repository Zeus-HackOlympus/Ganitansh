In the reign of the mughal emperor Jalalludin Mohammad Akhbar kwown as "Akhbar", the Rajput kings of Rajasthan were not surrendering their power to the Mughals.
After many invasions and beneficial proposals by Akhbar, many Rajput kings surrendered to him. He also sent many offers to Rana Pratap but he denied and was adamant.
On 18th June of 1576, a battle took place in Haldighati between Maharana Pratap of Mewar and Akhbar's led by Maan Singh of Amber.
It was a fierce battle. Unfortunately,Rana Pratap lost the battle though he managed to escape.
To hide he has to reach Koriyalli(a safe place towards south western Aravalli Hills )  but his way goes through jungles.
Now, help Rana Pratap to go through the jungle to reach Koriyalli hilly town from Haldighati (south of Mewar) safely.
Keep in mind some Mughal soldiers may follow you.
